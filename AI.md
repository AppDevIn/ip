# AI-Assisted Development

## Tool Used
- **Cursor Claude Sonnet** (AI-powered code editor)

## AI-Assisted Improvements

### Code Refactoring - Task.java
**Problem**: The `convertFromJson()` method was 40+ lines and doing too many things.

**AI Solution**: Refactored into 4 focused methods:
- `validateJsonFormat()` - JSON validation
- `extractJsonContent()` - Content extraction
- `findTaskType()` - Type field parsing
- `createTaskFromType()` - Task creation

**Result**: Main method reduced to 6 lines, better readability and maintainability.

### Testing Enhancement
**AI Assistance**: Expanded test coverage from 64 to 208 tests by identifying gaps and generating comprehensive test cases for command classes.

### Code Quality Improvements
**AI Assistance**: Fixed naming conventions, code style issues, and addressed code review feedback systematically.

## Impact
- Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
- Better separation of concerns
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Professional code quality standards
